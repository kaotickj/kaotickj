## Identity Clarification and Authorized Use Statement  
**Issued by: Johnny Watts (aka. "Kaotick Jay", "kaotickj", "DJ Kaotick Jay")**  
**Date: May 16, 2025**

I, KaotickJ, also known as Kaotick Jay in professional cybersecurity circles and DJ Kaotick Jay in music and artistic communities, am making this statement to clearly define the boundaries of my personal brand, online identity, and professional representation.

‚úÖ Authorized Names / Handles

The following identifiers are official and used by me across various domains, including cybersecurity, digital publishing, red team engagements, musical forums, and professional networking:

    KaotickJ (preferred short username/screenname)
    
    Kaotick Jay (preferred professional alias used for authorship and public engagements)
    
    DJ Kaotick Jay (used in music and creative arts communities)

These aliases may appear on content I have authored, music I have produced, social platforms I use, or professional accounts I maintain. All uses are within my full authorization.

‚ùå Unauthorized and Impersonated Variants

Any name or handle beginning with the string:

    "kaotic" (with a "c") rather than "kaotick" (with a "k")

is not me, does not represent my identity, and may constitute a case of unauthorized impersonation or misuse of my brand.

Examples include (but are not limited to):

    kaoticjay
    
    kaotic_j
    
    djkaoticjay

    Any similar spelling variation attempting to resemble KaotickJ or DJ Kaotick Jay

If you encounter such names misrepresenting themselves as me, I ask that you report them immediately to the platform in question. Impersonation of a cybersecurity professional or DJ with a recognized digital and authorial footprint can have legal ramifications, especially if misleading, defamatory, or abusive behavior is involved.

üì¢ Public & Legal Use

This statement may be used:

    As a reference in verifying my online or professional identity
    
    To dispute false claims or impersonation
    
    In DMCA takedown notices, platform reports, and cease-and-desist demands
    
    To clarify brand ownership and authorship in content attribution disputes

For verification or inquiries regarding the authenticity of any account or publication bearing my name, I can be contacted through verified channels upon request.
Signed,

Johnnys Watts, aka, "Kaotick Jay", "kaotickj", "DJ Kaotick Jay"
